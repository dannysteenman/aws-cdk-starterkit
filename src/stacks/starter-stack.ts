 * StarterStack
 *
 * This stack serves as the starting point for building your AWS infrastructure using CDK.
 * It provides a foundation for adding and organizing your AWS resources and constructs.
 *
 * @extends cdk.Stack
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Use this stack to begin defining your infrastructure components
 * - Add new constructs and resources within the constructor of this class
 * - Customize and extend this stack based on your specific infrastructure needs
 *
 * @example
 * To add a new S3 bucket:
 * ```
 * import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
 *
 * // In the constructor:
 * new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket', {
 *   bucketName: 'my-unique-bucket-name',
 *   versioned: true,
 *   encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @param scope - The scope in which to define this construct
 * @param id - The scoped construct ID
 * @param props - Stack properties including the deployment environment

    // - S3 buckets

    // Remember to import necessary modules at the top of the file
    // and to organize your constructs logically within this stack
    // or create additional stacks for different components of your infrastructure.
